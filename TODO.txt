- add param setter
- create a way to auto-generate a javadoc for methods based on param comments
- create a way to export the CSV files based on the current state
- add support for timestamp-based snapshots?
- add a way to blacklist nicks from executing commands

- The top group (currently admin) should be defined in the config file. As of now, it is not possible to have an admin group that can't run dangerous commands like sqlrequest.
